Hello! My name is Joel Parker and I am a Ph.D student in Biostatistics at the University of Arizona. I am developing this blog to provide a place to share my journey through the later years of my Ph.D with a broader audience. In doing this, I hope to accomplish two goals.

  1.  Share what I am learning as a Ph.D student in Biostatistics.

  2.  To grow as a scientist, author and communicator.

As a Ph.D student I have found great pleasure in reading blogs written by some of my statistical heroes like [Andrew Gelman](https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/) and [Frank Harrell](https://www.fharrell.com/#posts), which has partially inspired me to start this blog. Another inspiration is to connect with other young scientists who are at a similar stage in their career as me, because I believe we can learn from each other. Therefore, I welcome feedback and suggestions to what you found useful or if you have found a better way.

I look forward to connecting with you!

**Joel Parker**
